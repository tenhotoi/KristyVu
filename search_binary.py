Time complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the BST. This is because the maximum amount of space needed to store the recursion stack would be h.

Illustration to search 6 in below tree: 

Start from the root. 
Compare the searching element with root, if less than root, then recursively call left subtree, else recursively call right subtree. 
If the element to search is found anywhere, return true, else return false. 

For searching a value, if we had a sorted array we could have performed a binary search. Letâ€™s say we want to search a number in the array, 
in binary search, we first define the complete list as our search space, the number can exist only within the search space.

Time Complexity: The worst-case time complexity of search and insert operations is O(h) where h is the height of the Binary Search Tree. In the worst case, we may have to travel from the root to the deepest leaf node. The height of a skewed tree may become n and the time complexity of the search and insert operation may become O(n). 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Implementation: Insertion using the loop.
