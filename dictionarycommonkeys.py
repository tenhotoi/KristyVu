The time complexity of this program is O(n * log(n)), where n is the total number of items in both dictionaries. 
This is because the items() method returns a set-like object containing a view of the dictionaryâ€™s items, 
and the & operator performs a set intersection operation, both of which have a time complexity of O(n * log(n)). 
The sorted() function also has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)).
