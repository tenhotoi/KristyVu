User workflow.  Always keep the end user in mind. In the user workflow section, development teams should incorporate design discussion elements and add specific details of the anticipated user workflow, so they aren't missed during the design phase.

Let's revisit our medical support application example. If we want to add a feature to an application for a patient to record medication doses and order refills, the user story needs to outline the expected workflow. For example:

Patients fill out the form to sign up for the Medication Management Program through their medical provider.
Patient receives the Consent form, signs it and returns it electronically.
The Medication Management Program reviews the patient and accepts or denies their participation.
If accepted, the patient receives a welcome email or letter and call from a Patient Program Manager.
The patient receives their initial fulfillment of the medication.
The patient records dose intake for 3 months.
The patient reviews their medical records for accuracy. They check appointments theyâ€™ve attended and any results from those appointments.
If denied, the patient receives an email or letter indicating they are ineligible for the program.
Once the patient reaches the last 30 days of the three-month program, they automatically receive a refill.
The refill is sent Second Day air and requires the patient's signature.
The refill includes a patient-specific barcode.
The patient receives their refill and uploads the barcode.
The patient continues to track dose intake for the next 3 months.
The patient reviews their medical record for accuracy.
The cycle repeats so long as the patient remains active in the Medication Management Program.
When you add details to the user workflow, it ensures the designed code and testing efforts verify the workflow items are met. In other words, when the user receives your code release, they can perform the user workflow steps as expected.
